# Convex-Hull-Based-Real-Time-Object-Tracker-Using-Geometric-Shape-Analysis
This project explores **convex hull geometry** in real-time object tracking using video data. It combines computer vision and computational geometry to detect a red object, approximate its shape with a convex hull, and compare different geometric representations over time.
